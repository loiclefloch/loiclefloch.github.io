Welcome to the September edition of my tech newsletter! During the summer, we celebrated its one-year anniversary. Thank you for being part of this journey :)

Let's start with my favorites of the month:

- [How to Build a Medieval Castle](https://archaeology.org/issues/september-october-2025/features/how-to-build-a-medieval-castle/) - *Why are archaeologists constructing a thirteenth-century fortress in the forests of France?* A nice article on Guédelon, a project to build a medieval castle using only the techniques and materials available in the 13th century. The project started in 1997 and is expected to be completed around 2030.

- [How Stripe Ships 1,145 Pull Requests Per Day](https://blog.pullnotifier.com/blog/how-stripe-ships-1145-pull-requests-per-day) - How Stripe’s make hyper-fast delivery, using a combo of micro-PRs, CI/CD pipelines, and automation. Teams work in small, focused squads and break big features into tiny, reviewable changes that can be merged in minutes. Automated testing, auto-merge, and feature flags keep things safe without slowing down, while clever workflows kill notification overload and avoid bottlenecks. The guide shares actionable tips and KPIs so any dev team can ship faster.

- [You should add debug views to your DB](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/views-for-debugging) - On why we should created dedicated "debug views" on our sql databases. Instead of rewriting queries with a lot of joins each time we need to debug something, we can create views for common debugging tasks.

- [Secure Boot, TPM and Anti-Cheat Engines](https://andrewmoore.ca/blog/post/anticheat-secure-boot-tpm/) - Discover how anti-cheat technologies are working nowadays. Understand why online games requires Secure Boot and firmware TPM enabled. Secure Boot prevents untrusted kernel drivers, while TPM gives each machine a unique, provable identity, making hardware bans more effective.

- [How is japanese web design different?](https://sabrinas.space/) - An analysis of Japanese websites. Despite Japan's reputation for minimalist aesthetics, those websites tend to have a maximalist style with vibrant colors and dense content. It's interesting as a tech and design study that combines data science and cultural observation to challenge common design stereotypes.
