- [How we decreased GitLab repo backup times from 48 hours to 41 minutes](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2025/06/05/how-we-decreased-gitlab-repo-backup-times-from-48-hours-to-41-minutes/) - "Learn how GitLab tracked a performance bottleneck to a 15-year-old Git function and fixed it, leading to enhanced efficiency that supports more robust backup strategies and can reduce risk."

- [How to Design APIs for an AI World](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-design-apis-for-an-ai-world) - Designing APIs for AI involves rethinking existing conventions: it is necessary to optimize token consumption (because each byte is expensive), manage high latency, accept the non-determinism of operations, and make documentation an operational element of the system, because AI refers to it in real time. Protocols like MCP are emerging to standardize the interaction between AI and external services, but the future could move towards even smarter interfaces, where providers and consumers are agents capable of negotiating and collaborating in a flexible and dynamic manner.

- [How the Google Cloud Outage Crashed the Internet](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/how-the-google-cloud-outage-crashed) - A major Google Cloud outage on June 12, 2025, caused widespread disruption across the internet. The outage originated from a bug in Google’s Service Control system, triggered by a malformed policy update that caused a global crash due to instant metadata replication. Google’s rapid response with a “red-button” kill switch helped stabilize services, but the incident exposed critical weaknesses in cloud infrastructure design and monitoring

- [Legacy modernization](https://legacy-modernization.io/) - "Legacy-modernization.io is a comprehensive collection of proven patterns, strategies, and resources to help you plan and execute your modernization journey with confidence."

- [I Convinced HP's Board to Buy Palm for $1.2B. Then I Watched Them Kill It in 49 Days](https://philmckinney.substack.com/p/i-convinced-hps-board-to-buy-palm) - Phil McKinney explains how he led HP’s Palm acquisition, but the project failed quickly due to leadership and decision-making issues. The article serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of systematic thinking in innovation. McKinney introduces the DECIDE framework to help others avoid similar mistakes.

## Privacy

- [“Localhost tracking” explained. It could cost Meta 32 billion](https://www.zeropartydata.es/p/localhost-tracking-explained-it-could) - Meta developed a system called “localhost tracking” that secretly linked users’ web browsing activity on their mobile devices to their Facebook or Instagram accounts, bypassing privacy protections even when users took steps like using a VPN, incognito mode, or deleting cookies. This practice exposed Meta to potential record fines under for violating user privacy and data protection laws.
