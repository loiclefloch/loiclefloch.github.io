- [How to Think About Time in Programming](https://shanrauf.com/archive/how-to-think-about-time-in-programming) - This post offers a conceptual framework for reasoning about time in software, warning that handling instants, durations, time zones, and "the epoch" introduces subtle complexity. It advises sticking to modeling physical time with types like Java‚Äôs¬†`Instant`, using UTC as a reference but recognizing its limitations, and avoiding mixing physical and civil time to prevent buggy, zone-dependent code

- [Introducing tmux-rs](https://richardscollin.github.io/tmux-rs/) - A story of how the author is porting tmux code from C to Rust. It describes the technical challenges in translating C to Rust, the build process, and nuances of intrusive data structures.
